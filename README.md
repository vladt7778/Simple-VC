### What's even better? You can always remap everything by modifying the source code yourself! And even have a look at how you can further enhance the game, thanks to [DK22Pac](https://github.com/DK22Pac)!
<br>

# What you need to compile the source code
- A more Windows-inclined C++ compiler like MSVC, I recommend anything from Visual Studio 2017 onwards
- **Plugin SDK**, install it using this [link](https://github.com/DK22Pac/plugin-sdk)

# What you need to test/run the source code
- **The Ultimate ASI Loader**, install the released DLL module into the game root folder using this [link](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader), and also create a ***scripts*** folder there in case there isn't one
- A copy of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, in theory any version should be fine but try to aim for 1.0
- *Optionally*  [the multiplayer version](https://vc-mp.org/)

### After you compile the source code into an **.asi** file, put it in the scripts folder 
<br>

*Have fun!*
